### Currently we dont have any drivers for pong so this page is unused 

### Boot into Windows
> Flash the UEFI image in fastboot or use the WOA Helper app

### Installing Drivers
> Unpack the driver archive on your Nothing Phone (2) in Windows, then open the `OnlineUpdater.cmd` file

> Follow any instructions provided on the screen
